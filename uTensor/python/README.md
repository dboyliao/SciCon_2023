## Folder Descriptions
This folder contains a bunch of convenience scripts for maintaining the uTensor runtime codebase. Python is *NOT* included in the runtime builds.

- `test_scripts` are scripts wich generate testing files for `uTensor`

## Environment Setup

1. run `pipenv install -d --skip-lock`
2. run `pipenv shell` to laush the virtual environment and you should be ready to go

## TODOs
- python wrapper for `uTensor`
    - using `pybind11`?
